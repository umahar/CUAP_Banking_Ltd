Stage 1: Beginner - Basic Banking System
Goal: Implement basic functionalities of a banking system for one user.
Tasks:
Account Creation:
Create a function to initialize a bank account with a balance of 0.
Store account data in a dictionary.
Deposit Functionality:
Create a function to deposit money into the account.
Check for valid positive amounts.
Update the balance.
Withdraw Functionality:
Create a function to withdraw money from the account.
Ensure withdrawal doesn’t exceed the account balance.
Update the balance after withdrawal.
Check Balance:
Create a function that displays the current balance to the user.
Interactive Menu:
Create a simple command-line menu with options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit the system.
Use loops to keep the menu running until the user exits.

Stage 2: Intermediate - Multiple Accounts & User Authentication
Goal: Add support for multiple users, with account creation, login, and logout features.
Tasks:
Multiple Users:
Store multiple user accounts in a dictionary with usernames as keys.
Each user account should have a username, password, and balance.
User Registration:
Implement functionality for users to create an account with a username and password.
Ensure no duplicate usernames are allowed.
Login System:
Create a login system that verifies the username and password.
If credentials are valid, the user should be logged into their account.
Logout:
Add a logout option in the menu.
After logging out, the user should return to the login screen or be able to register a new account.
Interactive Menu for Logged-in Users:
Once logged in, users should see options to deposit, withdraw, check balance, and log out.
Make sure each user’s actions only affect their own account.

Stage 3: Advanced - Transaction History, Transfers, Interest
Goal: Introduce more complex banking features like transaction history, inter-account transfers, and interest calculations.
Tasks:
Transaction History:
For each account, keep track of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
Store each transaction with details like the type, amount, and timestamp.
Allow users to view their transaction history.
Transfer Between Accounts:
Implement a function that allows users to transfer money from their account to another account.
Ensure that transfers can only happen if the user has enough funds.
Update both the sender's and receiver's balances.
Record the transfer in both users' transaction histories.
Apply Interest:
Add a function to apply interest to account balances.
Use a fixed interest rate and calculate interest periodically (e.g., daily, monthly).
Add the interest as a transaction to the user’s history.
Enhanced Menu for Logged-in Users:
Add options for users to view their transaction history and transfer money to other accounts.

Stage 4: Pro - Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Web Application
Goal: Upgrade your banking system to have a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web interface.
Tasks:
Option 1: GUI Using Tkinter
Create a Main Window:
Use Tkinter to build a window for your banking system.
Add buttons for different actions (Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer, Check Balance, etc.).
Account Creation/Login Interface:
Create input fields for users to enter their username and password.
Add buttons for account creation and login.
Transaction Interface:
Create separate windows or pop-ups for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money.
Display account balance and transaction history in the main window.
Logout Functionality:
Add a logout button to return to the login window.
Option 2: Web App Using Flask
Set Up Flask Project:
Install Flask and set up basic routes for login, account creation, and the user dashboard.
Account Creation/Login Pages:
Create HTML forms for account creation and login.
Validate the forms and handle user sessions with Flask.
User Dashboard:
Build a dashboard where users can see their balance, transaction history, and transfer money.
Transaction Handling:
Create routes to handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Update the database and show success or error messages.
Implement Interest and Transaction History:
Periodically calculate and apply interest to all accounts.
Show the transaction history on the user dashboard.
Logout Functionality:
Add a logout route that ends the user session and redirects them to the login page.

Bonus Ideas for Further Exploration:
Security Enhancements:
Encrypt user passwords (you can use the hashlib library for basic encryption).
Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for login.
Database Integration:
Instead of using dictionaries, store user accounts and transactions in a database using SQLite or MySQL.
Currency Conversion:
Add functionality to convert money between different currencies.
Fetch real-time exchange rates using an API.
Admin Dashboard:
Create an admin interface where the bank can monitor all accounts, transactions, and set interest rates.
Notifications:
Send email or SMS notifications for major events (e.g., low balance, large withdrawals).
